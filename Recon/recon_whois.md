Registrar Details
Registrar: Gandi SAS
Abuse Contact: abuse@support.gandi.net

Gandi is a reputable registrar. Abuse contact details indicate where security notifications should be sent in case of real compromises. This is relevant in real-world engagements but only informational for our lab target.

Domain Status
Status: clientTransferProhibited

This setting prevents unauthorized domain transfers. It is a security-protective control and does not affect application-level vulnerabilities, but indicates the organization follows good registrar-level practices.

Name Servers
NS-105-A.GANDI.NET
NS-11-B.GANDI.NET
NS-140-C.GANDI.NET

The DNS infrastructure is hosted by Gandi.
No internal or custom DNS entries are exposed, reducing the risk of DNS misconfiguration leaks. However, DNS still remains a potential reconnaissance vector and must be monitored during testing.

DNSSEC
DNSSEC: unsigned

DNSSEC is not enabled.
This means DNS records are not cryptographically protected and could theoretically be spoofed — but exploiting DNS at this internship scope is out of scope and ethically restricted.
