Gobuster : Think of this like having a master list of common room names (like "kitchen," "basement," "attic") and walking up to a house you've never visited. You try to open the door to each room name on your list. If the door opens, you've discovered a hidden part of the house that wasn't visible from the front porch.

The command used is : gobuster dir -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/ -w /home/kali/Documents/content/20000.txt -q -t 50

-q,Quiet,"Tells the tool to ""stay focused."" It hides the big intro banner and unnecessary status messages, so your terminal only shows the actual results it finds."

output : 
/admin                (Status: 301) [Size: 169] [--> http://testphp.vulnweb.com/admin/]
/images               (Status: 301) [Size: 169] [--> http://testphp.vulnweb.com/images/]
/pictures             (Status: 301) [Size: 169] [--> http://testphp.vulnweb.com/pictures/]
/vendor               (Status: 301) [Size: 169] [--> http://testphp.vulnweb.com/vendor/]
/secured              (Status: 301) [Size: 169] [--> http://testphp.vulnweb.com/secured/]

/admin: This is a high-value target. It suggests there is an administrative login or dashboard. This is usually where an attacker would try to guess passwords (Brute Force) or find a login bypass.

/images and /pictures: These are likely storage folders. While they seem boring, security pros check them to see if "Directory Listing" is enabled—which might let you see every file uploaded to the site, including sensitive ones.

/vendor: This is a very interesting find for an intern! This folder usually contains third-party code, libraries, or packages (like Bootstrap, PHP units, etc.). If the "vendor" software is outdated, it’s an easy way to hack the site.

/secured: The name itself is a red flag. It implies there is "hidden" or "protected" content here. As a pentester, this would be the second place I’d look after the /admin folder.

[Size: 169]: This is the size of the HTML message the server sent back telling you to redirect. Since it's the same for all of them, it confirms the server is handling all these requests in a consistent way.

[--> http://...]: This is the destination. It’s simply showing you exactly where the server is pointing you.

The Gobuster scan successfully identified five hidden directories. Although the server returned 301 redirects, this confirms the existence of these paths. Of particular interest are the /admin and /secured directories for potential access control issues, and the /vendor directory for potential outdated third-party vulnerabilities.
