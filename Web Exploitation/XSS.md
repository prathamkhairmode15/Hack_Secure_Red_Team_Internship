What is XSS? 
Normally, a website sends data (text, images) to your browser. Our browser then follows the instructions (HTML/JavaScript) provided by the website to display that data.

XSS occurs when a web application takes "User Input" and displays it back on a page without checking it first. In our case, the Guestbook took your "comment" and treated it as code rather than text. We essentially tricked the website into sending your malicious instructions to anyone who visits that page.

Anatomy of Your Attack: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
The Payload: You entered a <script> tag. This is the HTML signal that tells a browser: "Stop reading this as text and start executing it as JavaScript code."
The Function: alert('XSS') is a simple JavaScript command that creates a pop-up box.
The Result: Because the Guestbook saved your entry and displayed it back to you (and others), the browser "ran" your comment as if the website developer had written it themselves.

Why is this dangerous? 
While a pop-up box (alert) is harmless, a real attacker wouldn't use a pop-up. They would use XSS to:
Steal Cookies: Using document.cookie to hijack a user's session and log in as them.
Keylogging: Recording everything a user types on that page.
Phishing: Redrawing the login form to steal usernames and passwords.
Redirects: Forcing the user to go to a malicious website.

Successfully demonstrated Stored XSS on the /guestbook.php endpoint. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database and rendering it back to the UI. This allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser session.
